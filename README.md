# Fitz JCR Housing Ballot System
[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/d9809cce796fad2fc9cf/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/CHTJonas/roomballot/maintainability)

This is the code repository for Fitzwilliam College JCR's online Room & Housing Ballot System.
It is very much still a work in progress and we do not have an estimated release date for a production version.

The initial incarnation of Roomballot was written in raw PHP with no frameworking.
This became unwieldy to maintain and develop so we transition to a Rails application.
Roomballot now runs exclusively on Rails, with a few helper scripts written in Python.
It is designed to run on the SRCF's web server, but in theory it should be easily deployed elsewhere too.
